Find Folio is a single-page resource directory with full text search that is meant to be a shareable and locally useable with no internet. It is meant to be shared as openly as possible to perpetuate its existence.

Find Folio will be updated as regularly as possible and will be checked for dead links and new sites as often as possible. There will be onion links at some point as well to ensure anonymous access and availability of resources and services that may one day be outlawed.
