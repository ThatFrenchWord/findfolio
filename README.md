## What is Find Folio?
Find Folio is a single-page resource directory with full text search that is meant to be easily shareable and locally useable with no internet.

Find Folio will be updated as regularly as possible and will be checked for dead links and new sites as often as possible. There will be onion links at some point as well to ensure anonymous access and availability of resources and services that may one day be outlawed.

## How to use Find Folio

You can search for resources by name, description, or tag.
You can also use the * or "all" to show all resources.
Click on a resource to open it in a new tab.
