  <h3>What is Find Folio?</h3>
  <p>Find Folio is a single-page resource directory with full text search that is meant to be easily shareable and locally useable with no internet.</p>
  <p>Find Folio will be updated as regularly as possible and will be checked for dead links and new sites as often as possible.

    <h3>How to use Find Folio</h3>
    <p>You can opt to download the page and open it in your browser, but this isn't required.<br/> 
      You can search for resources by name, description, or tag. <br/>
      You can also use the * or &quot;all&quot; to show all resources. <br/>
      Click on a resource to open it in a new tab.</p>
